== Installation ==

As of the moment, Project ZeroSlackr does not have
any sort of installer or package manager. I am, however,
in the process of writing one in Java (cross-platform)
based around ipodpatcher. Once that is done, I will
also make a SansaLinux one. For the time being, you will
have to "install" ZeroSlackr manually.

SansaLinux currently only supports the Sansa e200 V1
and e200R V1 series. That includes the e250, e260,
e270, e280 and Rhapsody versions of each. SansaLinux
and Rockbox do not currently support V2 models. To
tell which version your Sansa is, check the firmware
version; 01.xx.xx indicates a V1, 03.xx.xx indicates
a V2 (V2s also usually have an extra "V2" on the
bottom right corner on the back).
 
ZeroSlackr installation for Sansa e200s follows the
same steps as the iPod; see "Install.txt". If your
Sansa is a Rhapsody model (i.e. e250R, etc.) you
must first copy over "patch-files/rhapsody/pp5022.mi4"
to the root of your Sansa.

The files included here are the originals from the
SansaLinux installation process. Not having a Sansa
myself however, I am unable to confirm if the patch
scripts even work. If they do not, follow SansaLinux's
instructions in place of "3)".
