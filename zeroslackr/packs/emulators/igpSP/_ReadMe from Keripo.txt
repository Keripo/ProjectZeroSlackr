Modifications:
- moved gba_bios.bin and game_config.txt locations
- modified "change_ext" function to direct files to hard-coded locations (ie game save/config/cheat file locations)
- changed default frameskip value to 7
- tweaked L/R button assignments
- removed zack's fps counter
- removed bios warning delay pause (which doesn't show appear until after pressing centre anyway)

To do:
- reboot on quit (can't do anything since uses too much memory)
- look into why the menu isn't scaled for the nano
- reduce memory usage? (or let the porters handle that ; P )

Module:
- passes .gba parameters
