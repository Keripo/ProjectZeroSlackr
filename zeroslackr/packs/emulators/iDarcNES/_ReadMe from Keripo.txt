zacaj's website

Modifications:
- various path edits (see source)
- set max volume to 40
- changed scale dimensions (for scale = 1)
- supports .nes and .sms (only if iGameGear isn't installed)

To do:
- let zacaj finish up iGens and copy iGen's menu to iDarcNES
- fix volume bug (starts at max regardless of default setting)
- look into saving/loading?
- zipped rom support? (see iGameGear)

Module:
- passes .nes parameters
- checks if iGameGear is installed; if not, also passes .sms files
