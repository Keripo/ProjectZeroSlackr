To enter predictive text mode, hold down the action button. The first time you do this
the predictive text dictionary will be loaded from /usr/share/dict/ptextwords. A P will
appear in the bottom right corner of the text window to show you are in predictive text
mode. The buttons 2-9 will immediately enter characters. If there is more than one word
for a number sequence, use the 1 key to enter 1's after the word until it is the word
you want.
