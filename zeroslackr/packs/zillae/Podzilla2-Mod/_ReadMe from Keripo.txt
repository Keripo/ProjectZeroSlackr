SVN

Modifications:
- various string and path edits (see _mods.h)
- reads default scheme symlink from /sandbox (also hex edited)
- uses "skywards.cs" as default scheme and "Sabine_Doscbthm.fnt" as default menu font
- loads renamed modules from /root/PZ2Mods/
- saves module configurations in /sandbox

To do:
- recompile all the modules into organized menus rather than all in "Extras"
- recompile to accept parameters of what to load (or make different script files since has launching via px_exec_mod problem ;/ )

Module:
- Fastlaunches Podzilla2-Mod
