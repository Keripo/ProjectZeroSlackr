This scheme was created to celebrate July 1st,
i.e. Canada Day. The background picture was
taken from canadian-flag.org at
http://www.canadian-flag.org/canadian-flag-640.jpg
and is highly likely to be part of public domain.

While the picture is not under any clear license,
I am using it in this scheme as free content as
the picture is very small and degraded in quality
and is very likely shown as public domain. Usage
of this picture is not intended to cause any harm
or benefits to either parties. If you do not agree
with this view, do not use this scheme.

The .png files were created using Photoshop CS3 10.0.
To create them, the original images were resized,
the colour set to Indexed, Selective, 32, then
edited/cleaned up by hand. The monochrome images
were set to grayscale, then smudged by hand.
