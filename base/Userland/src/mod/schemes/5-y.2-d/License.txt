This scheme was created after I saw a 5-y.2-d
picture with an iPod in it. The background
artwork is drawn by Kantoku of the doujin group
"Afterschool of the 5th Year" or 5-y.2-d. Their
website is http://5-y.2-d.jp/ though it contains
links to adult material and is not safe for work
(NSFW!!!). The other graphics are also borrowed
from the website's background images, etc. The
original art can be found at the 2008-05-07 entry
or at http://5-y.2-d.jp/pict/2008-05-07_.jpg

While the artwork is not under any clear license,
I am using it in this scheme as free content as
the picture is very small and degraded in quality.
Usage of this artwork is not intended to cause
any harm or benefits to either parties. If you do
not agree with this view, do not use this scheme.

The .png files were created using Photoshop CS3 10.0.
To create them, the original images were resized,
the colour set to Indexed, Selective, 32, then
edited/cleaned up by hand. The monochrome images
were set to grayscale, then smudged by hand.
