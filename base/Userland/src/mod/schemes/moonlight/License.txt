The background image for the scheme is a modified
copy of an artwork that I (Keripo) commissioned from
TheNork a few years ago. The character copywrite is
owned by me (Keripo) and thus usage of the original
or any modified version (including this scheme's) is
not allowed without my explicit permission (though I
will probably grant it).
The original artwork can be found here:

The titlebar image was generated using the AmitySource
Userbar Generator program and comes with whatever
licensing restrictions UserBar Generator generated
images comes with.

The .png files were created using Photoshop CS3 10.0.
To create them, the original images were resized,
the colour set to Indexed, Selective, 32, then
edited/cleaned up by hand. The monochrome images
were set to grayscale, then smudged by hand.
