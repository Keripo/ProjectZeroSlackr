== Fast FAQ ==

Q: What is Project ZeroSlackr?
A: Read the "ReadMe from Keripo.txt" document.

Q: When I run the "patch" script I am told by iPod patcher
   that my iPod cannot be found when my iPod is clearly
   connected. Whats up with that?
A: If ipodpatcher says your iPod isn't connected but it is,
   you may not have full admin access; find a computer in
   which you do have admin access. If you have such
   privileges, iTunes is closed and your iPod shows up as
   a drive, it is possible that your iPod is not supported
   by iPodLinux. See the iPodLinux Generations wiki page.

Q: After trying out a few apps I keep getting this
   "blahblahblah is too big" message or a lot of random
   numbers and letters or my iPod just freezes. What gives?
A: Due to large number of SlackrPacks now and thus
   ZeroLauncher's larger footprint, your iPod will run out
   of memory (think RAM, not hard-drive space). This is
   partially due to memory fragmenting in the kernel (for
   which we need kernel developers (see this thread:
   http://ipodlinux.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=27395 )
   and sometimes due to bad programming in the apps
   (I did not write the majority of these applications and
   would not know how to fix such). The current solution
   to this is "reboot, reboot, reboot". See the iPodLinux
   "Key_Combinations" wiki page for information on how to
   force reboot your iPod.

Q: Help, I get a "Can't write to log on /dev/tty5!" every
   time I boot into ZeroSlackr! How can I fix of this?
A: This is a busybox-related issue but not one affecting
   anything (its just a warning message that can be ignored).
   I might recompile busybox one day with the message
   removed, but later.

Q: I installed ZeroSlackr and it works great, but how do
   I access the Linux partition?
A: The ZeroSlackr Framework uses a userland disk image
   through the "loop-mount" boot method originally
   introduced by DataGhost (see iPodLinux's
   "Installation:_Winpod_without_datacorruption" wiki page).
   More information on it can be found in the ZeroSlackr
   Framework's userland readme ("/boot/docs/userland/
   ReadMe from Keripo.txt"). For instructions on how to
   access/edit the userland image, see the
   "/boot/docs/userland/Loop-mount Instructions.txt".

Q: I'm trying to use your kernel with a normal iPodLinux
   installation and/or I am trying to use Loader2 args as
   the wiki page instructs but its not working. Why?
A: The kernel I use for the ZeroSlackr Framework is a
   modified version of the iPodLinux "Experimental_Kernel"
   wiki. See the comments of the "/boot/loader.cfg" file
   for instructions on how to use the kernel and loader2
   args (which I use "autoexec=").

Q: Your previous "Sneak Peak" and "Testing" pre-releases
   for Windows users had this nice little
   just-keep-clicking-"Next" GUI installer. Will there be
   one for this?
A: No. There won't be. And no, I don't plan to make one.
   If I wanted, it would take 5 seconds, but I won't
   because people shouldn't be that lazy. iPodLinux
   (and Linux for general) is not for everyone
   (i.e. the "keep clicking Next" generation) and at least
   this way (extract and run script) there is some kind of
   "manual" aspect of things. I will, however, be working
   on a Java-based package manager for managing SlackrPacks
   though work is being stalled at the moment while I work
   directly on ZeroSlackr stuff (I'll come back to it one
   day).

Q: All these packs are really cool but the ZeroSlackr SVN
   keeps getting updated and there are apps that have yet
   to be added. How can I build my own SlackrPacks?
A: To compile things for ZeroSlackr, see the
   "== Compiling ==" section of ""ReadMe from Keripo.txt"
   and follow the iPodLinux
   "Introduction_to_Compiling_for_iPodLinux" wiki tutorial.
   I have not finished adding everything I know to Project
   ZeroSlackr but if you're willing to help (and are an
   experienced C programmer), feel free to contact me via PM.

Q: I'm lame and want my iPod back to "normal". How do I
   uninstall this?
A: The only real "installation" that you did was add in
   the Loader2 bootloader. Everything else is just files
   copied over to your iPod (no partitioning or other
   modifications were done to your iPod). To uninstall the
   bootloader, use ipodpatcher with the "--delete-bootloader"
   argument. After that you can delete the directories
   containing ZeroSlackr files (i.e. bin, boot, dev, etc,
   and ZeroSlackr). More info can be found on Rockbox's
   ipodpatcher wiki page (see
   http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/IpodPatcher).

Q: Installing iPodLinux through Project ZeroSlackr is very
   easy! Will this ever be officially supported?
A: Project ZeroSlackr is a custom iPodLinux installation
   created by me (Keripo) but based off the work and ideas
   of many people. Because of my modifications, it is
   highly unlikely that it will become official (though I
   do hope the non-partitioning loop-mount install method
   becomes adopted as the official install method). Whenever
   I do make modifications that I believe are beneficial to
   the iPodLinux project, however, I do try to get the
   modifications committed upstream by the official
   developers (i.e. see http://ipl.nonb.org/search?q=Keripo
   if Trac wasn't down).

Q: Project ZeroSlackr is awesome! How can I thank you?
A: If you're an experienced programmer, feel free to contact
   me if you want to help. Otherwise, just leave a word of
   thanks in a Project ZeroSlackr thread on the iPodLinux
   forums. If you're really generous and want to donate,
   you can contact me (since I haven't set up donations
   on SourceForge) though I would better recommend you
   instead donate directly to the iPodLinux project via
   the iPodLinux "Donations" wiki page. Such money can go
   towards RE for the newer iPod models, etc.

Q: What about my question _____ which you didn't answer here?
A: This FAQ only covers the basics concerning Project
   ZeroSlackr. For more information on iPodLinux, see the
   iPodLinux page (http://ipodlinux.org). For more
   information on how certain packs/applications work, see
   the pack's own "ReadMe from Keripo.txt", documents in the
   pack's Misc/Docs, the pack's iPodLinux wiki page (if it
   has) and Google searches. If you think you have an
   important question that concerns only Project ZeroSlackr
   and I forgot to add here, please contact me through the
   iPodLinux forums.
