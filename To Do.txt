== To do ==

- Full SansaLinux support:
  - rebuilt the kernel with 2.4.32 source code
    and with the Sansa recognized as a separate iPod
	model (hw_ver = 0x8)
  - redo entire userland/startup system (make more
    like iPodLinux's ZeroSlackr's loop-mount startup)
  - rebuilt bootloader (maybe add cmdline args via
    different key prsses on startup?)
  - port hotdog and the rest of the apps (unless
    Sebastian finishes his port first)
- Add a "Known Issues" and "Works on" sections to
  "ReadMe from Keripo.txt"s
- Use Insune instead of PZ2 for ZeroLauncher
