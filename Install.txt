== Installation ==

As of the moment, Project ZeroSlackr does not have
any sort of installer or package manager. I am, however,
in the process of writing one in Java (cross-platform)
based around ipodpatcher. For the time being, you will
have to "install" ZeroSlackr manually.

Please note that ZeroSlackr can only be installed on
FAT-formatted Winpods that is currently supported by
iPodLinux.

iPodLinux currently supports/works on 5.5G iPod videos
and older with the exception of the iPod shuffles.
This includes: 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, iPod colour, iPod
photo, iPod mini 1G, iPod mini 2G, iPod nano 1G,
5G iPod video and 5.5G iPod video. iPodLinux (or
Rockbox or iPodWizard hacks) currently does not work on
iPod shuffles or any of the iPod newer models. This
includes: iPod shuffle 1G, iPod shuffle 2G, iPod nano
2G, iPod nano 3G, 6G iPod classic and the iPod Touch.
The reasoning behind this is Apple's added encryption
for the newer hardware. If you are not sure what iPod
model you have, see Wikipedia or iPodLinux's wiki's
"Generations" page (http://ipodlinux.org/Generations).

A Winpod is an iPod formatted by iTunes on a Windows
computer; ZeroSlackr will not work on iPods formatted
on a Mac (Macpods). If your iPod is a Macpod or you are
not sure or ZeroSlackr does not load from Loader2, you
should try restoring your iPod through iTunes installed
on a Windows computer (you may have to first use Windows
to reformat your iPod as FAT16 or FAT32).

If your iPod is both a FAT-formatted Winpod and is
currently supported by iPodLinux, you can install
ZeroSlackr on your iPod through the following
instructions:

1) Extract/copy the content of the ZeroSlackr archive
   (i.e. the "ZeroSlackr" folder, the "boot" folder,
   the "loader.cfg" file, etc.) directly to the root of
   your iPod.
   
   The "root of your iPod" means where your data files,
   music, etc. is normally stored. On Windows, it would
   be the drive representing your iPod (e.g. E:/). On
   Mac OS X, this would be somewhere in /Volumes. On
   Linux, this would be wherever you/KDE/Gnome mounted
   it (usually somewhere on /mnt or /media).
   
   Archives ending in .7z can be extracted using 7-zip
   or WinRAR on Windows and p7zip on Mac/Linux. Archives
   ending in .tar.gz can be extracted by most common
   archiving tools. Note that you do not need any source
   code archives (which have "src" in their names) to
   install ZeroSlackr.
   
   If you are on Windows or Mac and have troubles finding
   your iPod, make sure the "Enable disk use" checkbox
   is checked in iTunes.
   
2) Download the latest Rockbox build for your iPod from
   Rockbox's build website (http://build.rockbox.org/).
   Extract it directly to your iPod such that you now
   have a ".rockbox" folder among your "ZeroSlackr" and
   original "Notes" folders, etc. If you do not want to
   install Rockbox, skip this step; however, I highly
   recommend Rockbox over the original iPod software
   (often referred to as the "Apple OS") for music
   playback.
   
3) Run the patch script - this would be "patch.bat" for
   Windows or "patch.sh" for Macs/Linux. This will patch
   your iPod with Loader2 by using ipodpatcher.
   
   If you are on Windows, make sure that you have admin
   access. If you are on Linux, make sure the script and
   the "ipodpatcher" binary has full root permission and
   you run the "patch.sh" script through the console. The
   script is untested on Macs but should work the same
   way as on Linux.
   
4) Safely remove/eject/unmount/unplug your iPod after the
   patch script finishes successfully. Allow your iPod to
   reboot into a graphical bootloader (Loader2) and select
   the "ZeroSlackr" option.
   
5) Welcome to ZeroSlackr on iPodLinux. Explore around a bit
   and try a few apps. You can return to the original Apple
   OS by rebooting your iPod back into Loader2. To reboot
   your iPod, use "Power > Reboot iPod" in ZeroLauncher or
   force reboot by holding the correct key combination
   (see http://ipodlinux.org/Key_Combinations). When in the
   Apple OS, to return to Loader2, force reboot your iPod.
   
   Make sure to read all the documentation that comes with
   ZeroSlackr, starting with the "ReadMe from Keripo.txt",
   then "FAQ.txt" files in the root of your iPod. Files for
   each application (i.e. Slackr pack) can be found in their
   respective folder in "ZeroSlackr/opt". Make sure to read
   all the documentation for each Slackr pack (i.e. the
   "ReadMe from Keripo.txt"s and files in the "Misc/
   Docs.tar.gz" archives) for usage instructions and
   other information. For more general or iPodLinux-related
   information/questions, search Google, Wikipedia or even
   the iPodLinux wiki and forums.
