== Installation ==

As of the moment, Project ZeroSlackr does not have
any sort of installer or package manager. I am, however,
in the process of writing one in Java (cross-platform)
based around ipodpatcher. For the time being, you will
have to "install" ZeroSlackr manually.

iPodLinux currently supports/works on 5.5G iPod videos
and older with the exception of the iPod shuffles.
This includes: 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, iPod colour, iPod
photo, iPod mini 1G, iPod mini 2G, iPod nano 1G,
5G iPod video and 5.5G iPod video (no 5.5G iPod video
MacPods however due to a kernel bug). iPodLinux (or
Rockbox or iPodWizard hacks) currently does not work on
iPod shuffles or any of the iPod newer models. This
includes: iPod shuffle 1G, iPod shuffle 2G, iPod nano
2G, iPod nano 3G, 6G iPod classic and the iPod Touch.
The reasoning behind this is Apple's added encryption
for the newer hardware. If you are not sure what iPod
model you have, see Wikipedia or iPodLinux's wiki's
"Generations" page (http://ipodlinux.org/Generations).


If your iPod is currently supported by iPodLinux, you
can install ZeroSlackr on your iPod through the
following instructions:

1) Extract/copy the content of the ZeroSlackr archive
   (i.e. the "ZeroSlackr" folder, the "boot" folder,
   the "patch.bat" and "patch.sh files, etc.) directly
   to the root of your iPod.
   
   The "root of your iPod" means where your data files,
   music, etc. is normally stored. On Windows, it would
   be the drive representing your iPod (e.g. E:/). On
   Mac OS X, this would be somewhere in /Volumes. On
   Linux, this would be wherever you/KDE/Gnome mounted
   it (usually somewhere on /mnt or /media).
   
   Archives ending in .7z can be extracted using 7-zip
   or WinRAR on Windows and p7zip on Mac/Linux. Archives
   ending in .tar.gz can be extracted by most common
   archiving tools. Note that you do not need any source
   code archives (which have "src" in their names) to
   install ZeroSlackr.
   
   If you are on Windows or Mac and have troubles finding
   your iPod, make sure the "Enable disk use" checkbox
   is checked in iTunes.
   
2) Download the latest Rockbox build for your iPod from
   Rockbox's build website (http://build.rockbox.org/).
   Extract it directly to your iPod such that you now
   have a ".rockbox" folder among your "ZeroSlackr" and
   original "Notes" folders, etc. If you do not want to
   install Rockbox, skip this step; however, I highly
   recommend Rockbox over the original iPod software
   (often referred to as the "Apple OS") for music
   playback.
   
3) Run the patch script - this would be "patch.bat" for
   Windows or "patch.sh" for Macs/Linux. This will patch
   your iPod with Loader2 by using ipodpatcher.
   
   If you are on Windows, make sure that you have admin
   access. If you are on Mac/Linux, make sure to run the
   script as root (you may have to "chmod +x ./patch.sh"
   and maybe use "sudo ./patch.sh") from the terminal.
   
   Also make sure iTunes and any other programs accessing
   your iPod is closed and not running. If you are getting
   permissions issues with ipodpatcher, make sure that no
   program is accessing the iPod (i.e. in Mac, you will
   probably run into permissions issues due to Spotlight's
   indexing, etc. - you'll have to figure out work arounds
   yourself as I don't know how to use Macs).
   
4) Safely remove/eject/unmount/unplug your iPod after the
   patch script finishes successfully. Allow your iPod to
   reboot into a graphical bootloader (Loader2) and select
   the "ZeroSlackr" option.
   
5) Welcome to ZeroSlackr on iPodLinux. Explore around a bit
   and try a few apps. You can return to the original Apple
   OS by rebooting your iPod back into Loader2. To reboot
   your iPod, use "Power > Reboot iPod" in ZeroLauncher or
   force reboot by holding the correct key combination
   (see http://ipodlinux.org/Key_Combinations). When in the
   Apple OS, to return to Loader2, force reboot your iPod.
   
   Make sure to read all the documentation that comes with
   ZeroSlackr, starting with the "ReadMe from Keripo.txt",
   then "FAQ.txt" files in the root of your iPod. Files for
   each application (i.e. Slackr pack) can be found in their
   respective folder in "ZeroSlackr/opt". Make sure to read
   all the documentation for each Slackr pack (i.e. the
   "ReadMe from Keripo.txt"s and files in the "Misc/
   Docs.tar.gz" archives) for usage instructions and
   other information. For more general or iPodLinux-related
   information/questions, search Google, Wikipedia or even
   the iPodLinux wiki and forums.
