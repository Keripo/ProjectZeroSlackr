This is the free, demo version of Higurashi no Naku
Koro ni - Onikakushi-hen, translated to English by
Sonozaki Futago-tachi (days 1-5 and 9-13 translated).
After installing the demo and the patch, the original
Japanese "arc.nsa" was renamed to "arc1.nsa" and
copied to the English folder. Both translated "arc.nsa"
and original "arc1.nsa" were converted using nsaconv.

The original demo can be downloaded from the 07th
Expansion official website:
(http://07th-expansion.net/Soft/Taiken.htm) and the
English patches can be downloaded from Sonozaki
Futago-tachi's blog:
