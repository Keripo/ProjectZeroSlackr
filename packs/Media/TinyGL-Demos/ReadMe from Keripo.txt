Overview:
TinyGL
- TinyGL is a small implementation of the OpenGL
  3D-graphics enginge. TinyGL is for embedded
  systems and uses software only implementations.
- The iPodLinux port was done by courtc using the
  hotdog graphics engine but is still slow due to
  the iPod's low processing speed.
- The ZeroSlackr pack contains most of the TinyGL
  demos that come with the source code.
