Overview:
Hotdog
- Hotdog is a superfast compositing graphics engine
  written by slowcoder specifically for iPodLinux.
- Hotdog was initially intended to be used as the main
  graphics engine for podzilla2. It is now being used
  in the alternate GUI that is currently being
  developed by courtc and others (named "Insune" at
  the moment). It is also widely used in emulators to
  speed things up.
- The ZeroSlackr pack contains all the official hotdog
  demos, most of which were originally written for the
  desktop but later tweaked by Keripo to work on iPods
  (changes were committed upstream) as well as other
  hotdog demos (hotdog-ex) written in C++.
