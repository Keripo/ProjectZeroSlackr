Overview:
Frotz
- Frotz is a Z-Machine interpreter for playing Infocom
  games and other text-based adventure games
- The ZeroSlackr version uses the "dumb" console-text
  build with the terminal module as the ncurses target
  did not seem to work (may be ncurses problem). Sound
  support is added but not tested.
For more information, see:
- http://frotz.homeunix.org/frotz/
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine

Usage:
- Terminal launch games through "Media > Frotz > Games"
- Make sure to read each game's Readmes for understanding
  their commands
