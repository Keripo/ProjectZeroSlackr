Overview:
>>nano<<
- >>nano<< (or just "nano) is an iPodLinux graphical/musical
  demo created by the demogroup Kakiarts; it was the second and
  last demo ever made for iPodLinux platform (so far).
- It uses various programming techniques to render a
  pseudo-3D graphical demo with background music on-the-fly
  on the iPod nano (other models not supported).
- It was entered into the Evoke 2006 demoparty and placed
  1st in the "wild demo" compo.
- An MP3 file of the soundtrack (ripped from the non-realtime
  video) is also included in the ZeroSlackr pack.
