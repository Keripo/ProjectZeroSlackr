Hyarion's website

Modifications:
- string and path edits (see _mods.h of source)
- hid lots of startup scrolling text
- removed quit confirmation
- modified to accept doom.wad, doom1.wad and doom2.wad files as arguments passed by launcher
- bonus wad testing launch that tries all three methods (create "/root/Files/iDoom-Mod/Testing" folder and place wad file in it)

To do:
- test more wads???
- add support for adding pwads

Module:
- passes single wad file as either doom1, doom2, or doom.wad
- hard-coded read locations at "/root/Files/iDoom-Mod/"
- bonus wad testing launch that tries all three methods (create "/root/Files/iDoom-Mod/Testing" folder and place wad file in it)
