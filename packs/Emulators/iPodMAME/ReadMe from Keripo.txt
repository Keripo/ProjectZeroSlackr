Overview:
iPodMAME

  Machine Emulator) to iPodLinux.

  to start the "Alien Armada" game or select a supported
  romset in "Emulators > iPodMAME".
- A list of working romsets can be found in the "Roms"
  directory. Place your legally obtained  rom files in
  their proper folders. iPodMAME expects that the folders
  be named the as the expected game name.
