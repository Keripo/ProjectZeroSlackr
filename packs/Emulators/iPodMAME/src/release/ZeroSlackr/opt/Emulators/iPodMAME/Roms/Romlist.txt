The below are romsets supported by Prow's build of
iPodMAME. To check the files that are needed for each
romset, run iPodMAME (or the computer version) with
"-verifyroms" (e.g. "mame -verifyrom pacman"). Make
sure to place all required ROM files in their correct
folders.
Keep in mind that iPodMAME does not support all
romsets currently supported by mainstream MAME;
iPodMAME is based off MAME 0.18 (later MAME versions
started prioritizing hardware accuracy over speed
and the iPod may not be powerful enough to emulate
fast enough using newer MAME source code.
