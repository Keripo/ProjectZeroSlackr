Welcome to TimeWalk!

All you see here are historical zillae built back when iPodLinux was still young and new. Some of these custom builds demonstrating PZ0 progress while others integrate unofficial features. A few of them are alternate interfaces separate from podzilla legacy.

Many of these are incomplete and probably WILL NOT WORK on most iPod models. There are still a large number of historical zillae missing from this collection; please see "Missing" for the list.

The ZeroSlackr versions are all mostly hex edited in an attempt to be self-contained but are not all fully done. If you find important paths that need changing, please contact me.

Apart from that, enjoy!
