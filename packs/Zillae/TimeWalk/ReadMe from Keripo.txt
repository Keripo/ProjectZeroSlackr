Overview:
TimeWalk
- TimeWalk is a large collection/museum of old
  zillae/GUIs written by various developers during
  the course of iPodLinux/podzilla legacy development.
- Some of these zillae are custom/partial builds
  demonstrating PZ0 CVS progress while others are
  custom builds integrating unofficial features.
- A few of them (particularly iPod-Desktop, Owen-OS
  and Margarelon) are completely separate projects
  started to provide an alternate interface apart
  from podzilla legacy.
- Many of these zillae builds are incomplete and,
  due to their age,  probably WILL NOT WORK on most
  iPod models other than the older ones (e.g. < 4G).
- The ZeroSlackr versions are all mostly hex edited
  in an attempt to be self-contained. Due to the
  plethora of strings that would need to be hexed
  (and extra content that would need to be added)
  for complete encapsulation, only the important
  strings or those relating to the zillae's specialty
  have been edited. Thus, there will be a bit of
  litter here or there (if some important strings have
  not been modified, however, please contact me).
- Some of these zillae still have (mostly incomplete)
  source code available, which can be found in
  src/orig, but not worth the hassle to recompile.
- Although most of these files were obtained through
  fine-combing through old wiki uploads, through
  searching through files on my computer, or through
  the use of the ever-so-useful Wayback Machine,
  I was unable to obtain the files needed for all
  zillae whose existence were know.
- The MISSING list is as follows:
  (if you happen to have any of these on your computer,
   please contact me, thanks!)
  > iPodVX, Poke-Zilla, ill-zilla, PureZilla,
    king-zilla, multipodzilla
- There are also a few zillae names that were mentioned
  but for which there are little records of/ no release:
  > vanillazilla, MarioZilla, Canuckzilla
For more information, see each zillae's respective links
though most of their descriptions can be found here:
- http://ipodlinux.org/Podzillae

Usage:
- Launch the different zillae through the "TimeWalk"
  menu (not under "Zillae >" since so many).
- Remember that none of the zillae are guaranteed to
  work on your specific iPod model so don't cry "Wolf!"
  if it doesn't work for you.
- If it does work for you but you notice I missed a few
  string edits, contact me so I can correct them to the
  best of my ability (keep in mind that these were all
  pre-compiled a long time ago and I cannot recompile
  the majority of them due to lack of source code).
