Overview:
viPodzilla
- viPodzilla is a customized build of podzilla legacy (PZ0).
- It was one of the older PZ0 forks that were being worked on
  during PZ0's development and one of the most widely used
  during the time due to its frequent updating.
- Originally the first zilla to implement usage of the viP
  text editor, it is now most known for its unique,
  circle-based GUI on a somewhat similar level to iPodVX.
- Since it is based off podzilla legacy, viPodzilla
  will not run smoothly on iPod videos (5G/5.5Gs),
  which were introduced after PZ0 was abandoned.
- Due to lack of source code (e.g. most links are dead now),
  the ZeroSlackr pack uses a hex edited viPodzilla binary
  with no MPD support.
