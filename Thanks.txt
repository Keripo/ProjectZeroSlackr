A special thanks goes out to mundi who first helped
me set up a podzilla0 compiling environment, with
one thing leading to another.

A special, special thanks goes out to tequilaguru
who wrote the original iPodLinux installation tutorial
for nanos (before Arabfreak came and stole it) that
started it all for me. He was "the one" back in the days.

A special, special, special thanks goes out to Larry
Riedel who kindly sent me a Sansa e250 for SansaLinux
testing. Yay for kindness!

And of course, special, special, *special* thanks goes out
