Podzilla from CVS currently lacks a few files
required to compile with mikmod support. To be
able to add mikmod support, copy all files in
the "podzilla-mikmod" folder to the "mikmod"
folder of the source, overwriting the
ipodmikmod.c file. Currently, mikmod is not
under works so it may or may not work properly
with the new kernels. If you want a functional
version, use the podzilla 2 module. Nevertheless,
included for experimental purposes ; )
