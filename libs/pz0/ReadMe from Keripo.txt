These are the libraries needed for podzilla0/legacy
compiling. I compiled these a long time ago and
stripped things down to the bare minimum (just
the .a and .h files). All the original source files
(as well as all their accompanying documents)
are in the "src" folder, though I've long forgotten
their original download sources and how to compile
them (see the iPL wiki page for partial directions).
Just link these compiled libraries to where
you need them. For PZ0+MikMod, see my readme in
the "mikmod" folder.
